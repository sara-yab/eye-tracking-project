# eye-tracking-project

A controlled study was conducted with 37 participants using eye-tracking technology to examine how urgency and reputation affect developers' performance and cognitive processes in code review. Additionally, a machine learning approach was employed to develop a predictive model for patch acceptance rates.

The data and code are organized as follows:

data_extraction folder: Contains raw files and scripts for data extraction, along with a README file explaining their use.
machine_learning folder: Includes machine learning scripts and a README file providing details on their function.
The complete_data.xlsx file includes comprehensive data such as eye gaze metrics, survey results, and patch characteristics. Participant identities are anonymized and referred to by ID.
